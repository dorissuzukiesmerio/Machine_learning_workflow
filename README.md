# Machine_learning_workflow

Collection of scripts and notebooks useful when conducting a project

Part 1: Preprocessing
I. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Pandas profiling
- Map columns

II. Cleaning
- Get unique values and replace them with np.nan, numeric
- Get column names
- Set correct schema/datatypes. Get rid of invalid characters that might be problematic
- Get rid of "code" values such as 999

III. Imputation


IV. Aggregation
- Sum across different columns that have certain value

Part 2: Implementation
I. Machine learning algorithms
II. mlflow tracking
III. Econometric/Statistical models
IV. Hyperparameter tuning loop
V. Metrics
